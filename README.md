# MentorMatchPro

## Scenario
Junior developers often need one-on-one advice, but scheduling ad-hoc mentoring sessions with peers or seniors is chaotic. MentorMatchPro solves this by providing a structured platform for mentorship, scheduling, and feedback.

## üéØ Objective
Build a platform where users sign up as Mentors or Mentees, request and schedule video chat sessions, and leave post-session feedback.

## üë• User Roles
- **Mentees:**
  - Browse mentors
  - Request sessions
  - View their own sessions and feedback
  - Rate mentors after sessions
- **Mentors:**
  - Approve/decline session requests
  - Set availability
  - Manage and schedule sessions
  - View and collect feedback
  - Rate mentees after sessions

---

## üîê Authentication & Authorization
- **Email/password login** with secure session management
- **Role-based access:**
  - Mentees can only request sessions
  - Mentors can only manage their own requests
- **Data privacy:**
  - Users can only view their own sessions and feedback
